POWER MOSFET 
1ma / um for length so must be bigger

NOISE ON OUTPUT
look at thermal

COULD ADD DIFFERENTIAL STAGE IN
make PD or PI controller

CHANGE RANGE
5 V In
3.3 V  Out

TAKE REF OFF CHIP

OP AMP -5 to 5
must change my op amp to work like this
or make it so i don't need negative rails

INCREASE RESISTOR VALUE of feedback resistor divider

REDO LOOP GAIN
